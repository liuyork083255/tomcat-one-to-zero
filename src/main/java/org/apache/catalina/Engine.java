/**
 * An <b>Engine</b> is a Container that represents the entire Catalina servlet
 * engine.  It is useful in the following types of scenarios:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You wish to use Interceptors that see every single request processed
 *     by the entire engine.
 * <li>You wish to run Catalina in with a standalone HTTP connector, but still
 *     want support for multiple virtual hosts.
 * </ul>
 * In general, you would not use an Engine when deploying Catalina connected
 * to a web server (such as Apache), because the Connector will have
 * utilized the web server's facilities to determine which Context (or
 * perhaps even which Wrapper) should be utilized to process this request.
 * <p>
 * The child containers attached to an Engine are generally implementations
 * of Host (representing a virtual host) or Context (representing individual
 * an individual servlet context), depending upon the Engine implementation.
 * <p>
 * If used, an Engine is always the top level Container in a Catalina
 * hierarchy. Therefore, the implementation's <code>setParent()</code> method
 * should throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.

 *  一个 service 其实对应一个 container，也就是对应一个 engine  查看 /resoures/doc/tomcat整体架构图.png
 *  一个 engine 理解成一个物理服务器，这台服务器上可以部署多个域名，这个域名就是 {@link Host}，比如 www.1.com; www.2.com;
 *  但是一个域名可以部署多个应用，这个应用就是 {@link Context}，比如 www.1.com/app1; www.1.com/app2;
 *  一个 web-app 可以多个 servlet，比如 www.1.com/app1/servlet1; www.1.com/app1/servlet2;
 *  在 servlet 规范中将 servlet 称为 {@link Wrapper}
